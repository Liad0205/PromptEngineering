# Prompt Engineering Templates

A collection of prompts and templates for working with Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Overview

This repository contains specialized instruction sets and prompt templates for effective communication with LLMs across different domains and use cases.

## Instruction Sets

### Software Engineering

- **codex.xml** - General instruction set for expert software engineering assistance. Use for comprehensive programming support across languages and paradigms.
- **codex-backend.xml** - Specialized for backend engineering with focus on API design, database optimization, and server architecture.
- **codex-frontend.xml** - Tailored for frontend development with emphasis on UI/UX, responsive design, and modern frameworks.
- **codex-fullstack.xml** - Comprehensive instruction set for end-to-end application development, bridging frontend and backend concerns.

### Data & Machine Learning

- **codex-datascience.xml** - Optimized for data analysis, visualization, and statistical modeling workflows.
- **codex-mlops.xml** - Focused on machine learning operations, model deployment, and production ML systems.

### Infrastructure

- **codex-devops.xml** - Specialized for infrastructure as code, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud platform management.

### Meta-Prompting

- **PromptBuilder.xml** - Meta-instruction set for prompt engineering assistance. Use this when you need help crafting effective prompts for other LLMs.
- **copilot-instructions.md** - Guidelines for effectively pair programming with GitHub Copilot, including best practices and optimization techniques.

## Usage

To use these instruction sets:

1. Copy the content of the relevant XML/MD file
2. Paste it at the beginning of your conversation with an LLM
3. Follow with your specific questions or requirements

For the best results, choose the instruction set that most closely aligns with your current task or domain.
