<user_request>I need to implement a rate limiter in my microservice.</user_request>
<llm_response>
<response>A rate limiter is a good way to protect your service from overload. Here's an example implementation in Go using the `time` and `sync` packages:</response>
<code language="go">
package main

import (
"fmt"
"sync"
"time"
)

type RateLimiter struct {
rate int // Number of allowed requests per second
bucket chan struct{} // Token bucket
mu sync.Mutex
lastCheck time.Time
}

func NewRateLimiter(rate int) \*RateLimiter {
rl := &RateLimiter{
rate: rate,
bucket: make(chan struct{}, rate),
}
rl.lastCheck = time.Now()
return rl
}

func (rl \*RateLimiter) Allow() bool {
rl.mu.Lock()
defer rl.mu.Unlock()

    now := time.Now()
    elapsed := now.Sub(rl.lastCheck)
    rl.lastCheck = now

    // Refill tokens
    tokensToAdd := int(elapsed.Seconds()) * rl.rate
    for i := 0; i < tokensToAdd && len(rl.bucket) < rl.rate; i++ {
        rl.bucket <- struct{}{}
    }

    select {
    case <-rl.bucket:
        return true // Request allowed
    default:
        return false // Request rate limited
    }

}

func main() {
limiter := NewRateLimiter(5) // Allow 5 requests per second

    for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
        if limiter.Allow() {
            fmt.Println("Request", i+1, "allowed")
        } else {
            fmt.Println("Request", i+1, "rate limited")
        }
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond) // Simulate requests
    }

}

<response>This implementation uses a token bucket algorithm. The `Allow()` method checks if a token is available in the bucket. If so, it removes a token and returns `true`. Otherwise, it returns `false`. This approach ensures a consistent rate limit over time. Are there specific aspects of rate limiting you'd like to explore further, such as different algorithms or integration with a specific framework?</response>
